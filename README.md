Run the html file, use the A and D keys to move around, and don't let the pole fall!

This project takes inspriation from the cartpole problem from "Introduction to Reinforment Learning" by Sutton and Barto.

I hope to implement an agent to play the game in the coming weeks

Currently on version 1.

Known bugs:
- When moving in the direction of the falling pole, the pole slows drastically when close to touching ground
- Large acceleration may cause the pole to do a full rotation - skipping the falling check

Possible improvements:
- Create an AI to play the game
- When off screen, appear on other end
